# Species-Distribution-Modeling-Crash-Course
This is an on-going repository of talks and workshops I generated to introduce fellow PhD students (University of Notre Dame, Dept. of Biological Sciences) to species distribution models (SDMs). No prior experience is absolutely necessary: however, an understanding of basic ecology & statistical theory makes for a good starting point. Presentations and workshops were made by Nicholas A Galle, based on materials from Chris P Randle. 

The general order of presentations will be as follows: 1) Species Distribution Modeling: Overview, Assumptions, & Violations, 2) Occurrence Point Cleaning & Background Point Generation, 3) Considerations When Selecting Predictor Data, 4) An Overview of Common SDM Algorithms, & 5) Evaluating Species Distribution Models.

The creation of these presentations is on-going, and I am focusing more on creating interactive scripts in R-Studio. If you have any particular subject you want more material for please reach out to me at ngalle@nd.edu.
