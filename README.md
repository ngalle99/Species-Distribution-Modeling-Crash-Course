# Species-Distribution-Modeling-Crash-Course
This is a repository of talks and workshops I generated to introduce fellow PhD students (University of Notre Dame, Dept. of Biological Sciences) to species distribution models (SDMs). No prior experience is absolutely necessary: however, these talks were made for people with (at least) an understanding of basic ecology & statistical theory. Presentations and workshops here were generated by Nicholas A Galle, based on materials from Chris P Randle (Sam Houston State University, Dept. of Biological Sciences). 

The currently included presentations are as follows: 1) Species Distribution Modeling: Overview, Assumptions, & Violations, 2) Occurrence Point Cleaning & Background Point Generation, 3) Considerations When Selecting Predictor Data, 4) An Overview of Common SDM Algorithms.  

Future works may be published here regarding SDM evaluation, among other topics. As I do not update my GitHub as regularly as I should, please reach out to me at ngalle@nd.edu or nickgalle99@gmail.com if you have any questions regarding this material.
